# Mood_Detection

This project explores how different types of sensor data can be used together to detect early mood changes in elderly individuals with dementia. The aim is to support non-pharmacological care by identifying signs of agitation, depression, or other behavioral symptoms before they escalate.

The work investigates sensor fusion techniques involving physiological signals, as well as modalities like audio and visual input. Various combinations and models will be evaluated throughout the project.
