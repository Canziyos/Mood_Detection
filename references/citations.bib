abstract = {Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code.}

ABSTRACT = {Methods for detecting emotions that employ many modalities at the same time have been found to be more accurate and resilient than those that rely on a single sense. This is due to the fact that sentiments may be conveyed in a wide range of modalities, each of which offers a different and complementary window into the thoughts and emotions of the speaker. In this way, a more complete picture of a person’s emotional state may emerge through the fusion and analysis of data from several modalities. The research suggests a new attention-based approach to multimodal emotion recognition. This technique integrates facial and speech features that have been extracted by independent encoders in order to pick the aspects that are the most informative. It increases the system’s accuracy by processing speech and facial features of various sizes and focuses on the most useful bits of input. A more comprehensive representation of facial expressions is extracted by the use of both low- and high-level facial features. These modalities are combined using a fusion network to create a multimodal feature vector which is then fed to a classification layer for emotion recognition. The developed system is evaluated on two datasets, IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI, and shows superior performance compared to existing models, achieving a weighted accuracy WA of 74.6% and an F1 score of 66.1% on the IEMOCAP dataset and a WA of 80.7% and F1 score of 73.7% on the CMU-MOSEI dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {Speech is the most significant mode of communication among human beings and a potential method for human-computer interaction (HCI) by using a microphone sensor. Quantifiable emotion recognition using these sensors from speech signals is an emerging area of research in HCI, which applies to multiple applications such as human-reboot interaction, virtual reality, behavior assessment, healthcare, and emergency call centers to determine the speaker’s emotional state from an individual’s speech. In this paper, we present major contributions for; (i) increasing the accuracy of speech emotion recognition (SER) compared to state of the art and (ii) reducing the computational complexity of the presented SER model. We propose an artificial intelligence-assisted deep stride convolutional neural network (DSCNN) architecture using the plain nets strategy to learn salient and discriminative features from spectrogram of speech signals that are enhanced in prior steps to perform better. Local hidden patterns are learned in convolutional layers with special strides to down-sample the feature maps rather than pooling layer and global discriminative features are learned in fully connected layers. A SoftMax classifier is used for the classification of emotions in speech. The proposed technique is evaluated on Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) and Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) datasets to improve accuracy by 7.85% and 4.5%, respectively, with the model size reduced by 34.5 MB. It proves the effectiveness and significance of the proposed SER technique and reveals its applicability in real-world applications.},

abstract = {This paper proposes two multimodal fusion methods between brain and peripheral signals for emotion recognition. The input signals are electroencephalogram and facial expression. The stimuli are based on a subset of movie clips that correspond to four specific areas of valance-arousal emotional space (happiness, neutral, sadness, and fear). For facial expression detection, four basic emotion states (happiness, neutral, sadness, and fear) are detected by a neural network classifier. For EEG detection, four basic emotion states and three emotion intensity levels (strong, ordinary, and weak) are detected by two support vector machines (SVM) classifiers, respectively. Emotion recognition is based on two decision-level fusion methods of both EEG and facial expression detections by using a sum rule or a production rule. Twenty healthy subjects attended two experiments. The results show that the accuracies of two multimodal fusion detections are 81.25\% and 82.75\%, respectively, which are both higher than that of facial expression (74.38\%) or EEG detection (66.88\%). The combination of facial expressions and EEG information for emotion recognition compensates for their defects as single information sources.},
